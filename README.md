# Kālīon Field — Empirical Validation Suite

A two-parameter scalar-tensor framework tested against cosmological, astrophysical, and quantum datasets. Executable notebooks.

---

## Overview

We propose a two-parameter solution that unifies information theory, black hole physics, cosmology, quantum mechanics, and galactic dynamics. The framework resolves the Hubble tension, derives MOND phenomenology, and demonstrates measurable entropy reduction across multiple experimental platforms. All claims are falsifiable — the validation protocol is in Paper XI Section 13; additional falsification criteria are documented throughout the Compendium.

## Empirical Validation

This framework has been validated across four AI architectures, IBM and Rigetti quantum processors, and multiple independent datasets spanning cosmology (Planck, Pantheon+, DESI, SH0ES), astrophysics (SPARC, Gaia, EHT), gravitational wave physics (LIGO/GWTC), and precision metrology (NIST, Cassini). All protocols include references and reproducible validation suites.

## Falsification Criteria

Strict falsification criteria are linked to planned experiments in 2026–2027:

- Atomic clock drift measurements (optical lattice comparisons)
- Quantum coherence tests (IonQ, extended gate-depth protocols)
- Pulsar timing array analysis (NANOGrav/EPTA correlation)
- JWST high-z galaxy mass evolution
- Fifth-force evasion experiments (torsion balance, Eöt-Wash class)

## Our Commitment

We are committed to uncovering the truth and urge rapid falsification or validation. Either outcome advances science.
